# Rebellion Allstars

## Welsh competitive cheerleading team, first project

This is my first project and I am very worried on how this is going to turn out!


This project is for my cheerleading team, it provides extra credibility for the team by having an online presence in website form.

## Issues 

I thought I'd write what I would like to change but don't know how (any help appreciated)

1. I'd like the header slightly larger and to say Rebellion Allstarts with Allstar Competitive Cheer Team underneath. 
2. I'd like to menu to align right, cannot get it to move to the right.
3. Space out the footer items, I've tried spacing this accross the page but to no avail.
4. In about us, I'd like nicer styling of the coaches section
5. I'd like the coaches section to read vertically
